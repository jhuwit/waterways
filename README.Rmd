The goal of waterways is to provide code to read and analyze SensorLog data along with ActiGraph data for the OCEANS/WAVES studies.

## Installation

You can install the development version of waterways from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jhuwit/waterways")
```

## Example

### Read in GT3X data:

```{r}
library(waterways)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r example}

file_gt3x = ww_example_gt3x_file()
file_gt3x
ag = ww_read_gt3x(file_gt3x, verbose = FALSE, apply_tz = FALSE)
head(ag)
lubridate::tz(ag$time)
```


### Reading in the data
The data is read in using the `ww_read_sensorlog` function:

```{r read_sensorlog}
file = ww_example_sensorlog_file()
df = ww_read_sensorlog(file, robust = FALSE)
df = df %>% select(-file) # we don't need to see which file this came from
head(df)
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  add_count(time) %>% 
  filter(n > 1) %>% 
  select(time, lat, lon, starts_with("accel"))
```


```{r process_sensorlog_for_real}
df = ww_process_sensorlog(df, check_data = FALSE, apply_tz = FALSE)
df
```


```{r process_sensorlog_min}
df_min = ww_minute_sensorlog(df)
df_min
```
